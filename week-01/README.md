# Week 1: Introduction
## Getting Started
First, please accept the invitation to the class Slack which you should have received via your LMU email. Next, create a GitHub account: https://github.com/. I highly recommend you use a professional screenname as we build up your coding portfolio throughout the class, and you can use GitHub to highlight your work for future job postings. 

After you have signed up with GitHub, send a direct message to Dr. Pagán on Slack with your username. I will add it to the approved list of people who can access our shared JupyterLab environment.

## Accessing Shared Workspace
Navigate to: https://geospatial-data-analytics.briannapagan.com/
You will be prompted to log in with your GitHub username, which once Dr. Pagán has approved, you will have access to. 
Over the course of the class, you be accessing class activities, quizzes and the final exam via this coding environment. It has additionally been set-up for you to practice coding exercises and work on your class project without having to install anything on your local computers (yay!). 

## First Exercise
Following our introduction slides, open the first example jupyter notebook and play around with various geographical projections. The purpose of this exercise is more to ensure you have access to Slack, GitHub and our shared JupyterLab. Week 02 will focus on geographic principles, including projections.
