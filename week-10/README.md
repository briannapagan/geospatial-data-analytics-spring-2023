# Week 10: Spatial Analysis Part 02 and Interactive Maps


## Getting Started
During class, navigate to the following [link](http://geospatial-data-analytics.briannapagan.com/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbriannapagan%2Fgeospatial-data-analytics-spring-2023&branch=main&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fgeospatial-data-analytics-spring-2023%2Fweek-10) to access notebooks where we will be learning some core concepts.


You will be expected to follow along and 'live script' the examples in your own notebook.
