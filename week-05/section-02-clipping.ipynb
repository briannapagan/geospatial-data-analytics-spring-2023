    "## What Is Clipping or Cropping Data?\n",
    "When you clip or crop spatial data you are removing the data outside of the clip extent. This means that your clipped dataset will be SMALLER (have a smaller spatial extent) than the original dataset. This also means that objects in the data such as polygons or lines will be CUT based on the boundary of the clip object.\n",
    "\n",
    "![_._](img/spatial-extent.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When Do You Want to Clip Data?\n",
    "You may want to clip your data for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You have more data than you need. For example you have data outside of your study area that you don’t need to process. Clipping it to the study area boundary will make it smaller and easier to manage!\n",
    "2. If you have data outside of your study area and you clip it, you can perform analysis on only that region - thus you won’t need to subset the data further when you perform summary statistics for example.\n",
    "3. When you plot the data you will only see the study region.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will learn how to both crop your data and zoom in on an extent below.\n",
    "Get started by loading your libraries. And be sure that your working directory is set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson you will find examples of how to clip point and line data using geopandas. At the bottom of the lesson you will see a set of functions that can be used to clip the data in just one line of code. This lesson explains how those functions are built."

    "To clip points, lines, and polygons, GeoPandas has a function named ```clip()``` that will clip all types of geometries. This operation used to be much more difficult, involving creating bounding boxes and shapely objects, while using the GeoPandas ```intersection()``` function to clip the data. However, to simplify the process EarthPy developed a ```clip_shp()``` function that would do all of these things automatically. The function was than picked up by GeoPandas and is now a part of their package! Just a small example of how awesome working with open source software can be.\n",

If False, return all resulting geometries (potentially mixed-types). Default value is False (You don’t need to worry about this argument for this assignment)\n",

    "### Clip a Line or Polygon Layer to An Extent\n",
    "The process for clipping a line or polygon layer is slightly different than clipping a set of points. To clip a line of polygon feature you will do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ensure that your polygon and line layer are in the same coordinate reference system\n",
    "2. Identify what features in the lines layer fall WITHIN the boundary of the polygon layer\n",

    "This last step may seem unusual. When you clip data using shapely and geopandas the default behaviour is for it to only return the clipped geometry. However you may wish to also retain the attributes associated with the geometry. This is where the ```set_geometry()``` method comes into play.\n",
