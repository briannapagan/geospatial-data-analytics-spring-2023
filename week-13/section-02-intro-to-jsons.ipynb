    "# Introduction to JSON Data in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, you will explore the machine readable JSON data structure. Machine readable data structures are more efficient - particularly for larger data that contain hierarchical structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Review\n",
    "Remember that in the first section in this module, you learned about RESTful APIs. You explored the concept of a request and then a subsequent response. The request to an RESTful API is composed of a URL and the associated parameters required to access a particular subset of the data that you wish to access.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you send the request, the web API returns one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The data that you requested or\n",
    "2. A failed to return message which tells us that something was wrong with your request.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going any further, revisit the **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation or **JSON*** data structure that you learned about in the introductory lesson in this module. JSON is an ideal format for larger data that have a hierarchical structured relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ```Python```, ```JSON``` data is similar to a dictonary because it has keys (i.e. names) and values, but it is encoded as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```Python``` library ```json``` is helpful to convert data from lists or dictonaries into ```JSON``` strings and ```JSON``` strings into lists or dictonaries. ```Pandas``` can also be used to convert ```JSON``` data (via a ```Python``` dictionary) into a ```Pandas``` ```DataFrame```.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of a ```JSON``` object is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data are in name/value pairs using colons :.\n",
    "- Data **objects** are separated by commas.\n",
    "- Curly braces ```{}``` hold the objects.\n",
    "- Square brackets ```[]``` can be used to indicate an array that contains a group of objects.\n",
    "- Each **data element** is enclosed with quotes \"\" if it is a character, or without quotes if it is a numeric value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a name/value pair using a colon:\n",
    "```\n",
    " { \"name\":\"Chaya\" }\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example of objects separated by commas:\n",
    "```\n",
    "{ \"name\":\"Chaya\", \"age\":12, \"city\":\"Boulder\", \"type\":\"Canine\" }\n",
    "```\n",
    "Notice that the data above are structured. Thus, each element contains a particular object name (name, age, city, etc) and values are associated with these names. This is similar to column headings in a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the JSON structure can also be nested using square brackets to indicate an array that contains a group of objects, like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "{\"students\":[\n",
    "    { \"firstName\":\"Serena\", \"lastName\":\"Williams\" },\n",
    "    { \"firstName\":\"Boe\", \"lastName\":\"Diddly\" },\n",
    "    { \"firstName\":\"Al\", \"lastName\":\"Gore\" }\n",
    "]}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The ability to store nested or **hierarchical** data within a text file structure makes ```JSON``` a powerful format to use as you are working with larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## JSON Data Structures\n",
    "```JSON``` can store any of the following data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- strings\n",
    "- numbers\n",
    "- objects (```JSON``` object)\n",
    "- arrays\n",
    "- booleans (TRUE / FALSE)\n",
    "- null\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in the example below, the word “Chaya”, which is the value associated with “name”, is in quotes ```\"\"```. This specifies that “Chaya” is a string (characters rather than numeric).\n",
    "```\n",
    " { \"name\":\"Chaya\" }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the value 12, associated with “age”, is not in quotes. This specifies that this value is a number or of type ```numeric```.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{ \"name\":\"Chaya\", \"age\":12, \"city\":\"Boulder\", \"type\":\"Canine\" }\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next lesson, you will work with JSON structured data, accessed via a RESTful API. A snippet of the data that you will work with is below. Notice that the ```JSON``` is enclosed in brackets ```[]``` to indicate an array containing a group of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
