    "\n",
    "Last week you practiced single band raster calculations using Sentinel-2 satellite remote sensing data. This week you will practice working with the multiple bands associated with Sentinel-2 data in order to create RGB composites and other band manipulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Sentinel-2 bands are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![_._](img/sentinel-2-bands.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will compare RGB and NDVI images from May 2018 (```data/pre-woolsey-fire/```) and February 2019 (```data/post-woolsey-fire```) over the Santa Monica Mountains which correspond to pre and post-Woolsey fire. The Woolsey fire occured in November 2018. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an **automated workflow** which loads, stacks and cleans the bands of a single Sentinel-2 date. \n",
    "2. Run this workflow for both dates: pre and post Woolsey fire.\n",
    "3. Map the RGB composites for both dates.\n",
    "4. Calculate the NDVI and map both dates.\n",
    "5. Write a few sentences of what differences you see between the RGB/NDVI maps. \n",
