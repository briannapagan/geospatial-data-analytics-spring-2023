# Week 04: Geographic concepts and map anatomy
## Getting Started
During class, navigate to the following [link](http://geospatial-data-analytics.briannapagan.com/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbriannapagan%2Fgeospatial-data-analytics-spring-2023&branch=main&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fgeospatial-data-analytics-spring-2023%2Fweek-04) to access notebooks where we will be learning some core concepts.

We will be going over the following sections from Chapter 03: Basic Programing Concepts https://pythongis.org/part1/chapter-06/index.html 

- Gettings started with geospatial data analysis
- Geomtric objects
- Coordinate reference systems/projections

You will be expected to follow along and 'live script' the examples in your own notebook.
