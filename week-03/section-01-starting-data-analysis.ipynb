It is a mature data analytics framework that is widely used among different fields of science. The development of pandas started in 2008 and it is now maintained by an active developer community ({cite}`McKinney2017`). \n",

It combines the performance of powerful Python libraries such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) [^numpy], [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) [^matplotlib] and [SciPy](https://scipy.org/) [^scipy].\n",

    "## Pandas data structures\n",
    "\n",
    "In pandas, table-like data are stored in two-dimensional `DataFrame` objects with labeled rows and columns. The pandas DataFrame was originally inspired by data frames that are in-built in the R programming language. You can think of the pandas DataFrame as a programmable spreadsheet. One-dimensional sequences of values are stored in pandas `Series`. One row or one column in a pandas DataFrame is actually a pandas Series. You can think of a pandas Series as a clever list. These pandas structures incorporate a number of things we've already encountered earlier in this book, such as indices, data stored in a collection, and data types.\n",

In the next sections, we will use many of these features to explore real-world data and learn some useful data analysis procedures. For a comprehensive overview of pandas data structures, we recommend you to have a look at pandas online documentation about data structures [^pandas_ds] as well as Chapter 5 in {cite}`McKinney2017`."
