    "\n",
    "Time is one of the most fundamental ways how we humans organize things in life and what we use to find understanding of the underlying world, as Stephen {cite}`hawking1988` famously put it in his book \"A brief history of time\". Hence, it is not surprising that the time dimension is very commonly attached to almost all data that we have in the world (the other dimension is naturally space or location, which we will focus in Part II). Hence, being able to handle and work with temporal information is extremely important when doing data analysis. Time information in the data allows us to see patterns through time (trends) as well as to make predictions into the future (at varying level of confidence). In this section, we will introduce some of the core ideas and functionalities how you can work with temporal data in Python and pandas."

    "## Date and time basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing any progamming, we need to understand a few details about time conventions themselves. There are a couple of ways how the time information (commonly referred as `timestamp`) is typically represented. The first one is to represent the temporal information as text with specific format such as `\"2020-12-24T09:12:45Z\"` which follows an international ISO 8601 standard [^isostandard]. In this format, the date components (year, month, day) are separated with dash (`-`) and the time components (hour, minute, second) are separated with colon (`:`). Typically there is a letter `T` separating the date and time components from each other (in some other formats, there could just be a space between them). \n",
    "\n",
    "The letter `Z` at the end of the string relates to time zones and means that the time here is represented as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Time zone information around the world are expressed using negative or positive offsets from the UTC time standard. `UTC±00:00` is the same as Greenwhich Mean Time (GMT) used e.g. in UK (during winter months), and it was chosen after a series of conferences between 1881-1884 (Ogle, 2015) as the worldwide standard for representing the zone 0 to which all other time zones in the world are relative to. For instance, the local time in Finland is two hours ahead of UTC, meaning that the time zone information is expressed as `UTC+2` or `UTC+02:00`, whereas the local time in New York is four hours behind UTC respectively (i.e. `UTC-4`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Another commonly used way to represent time in addition to ISO standardized timestamp is to use a so called *Unix time* (also known as *Epoch time* or *POSIX time*). Unix time is expressed as number of seconds since *Unix Epoch* that was on the first of January 1970 at midnight in UTC (i.e. `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`). This system was developed to describe a point in time in numerical format, and it is widely used in computers by different operating systems. Unix time increments every second and e.g. the Unix time of December 22nd 2020 at 15:00:00 (UTC) is represented as a single number `1608649200`. Using this kind of numerical representation of time makes it much easier for computers to store and manipulate the time information compared to having the information in textual format (`2020-12-22T15:00:00Z`). \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, an important convention that relates to time and time zones is a concept called Daylight Saving Time (DST), also known as summer time. DST is a commonly used practice for advancing clocks typically by an hour during warmer months so that darkness falls at a later clock time. This is also the reason why e.g. the time zone information in Finland has an offset of +03:00 (summer time) instead of +02:00 which follows the official time zone specification for Finland. DST became a common practice after the global energy crisis in the 1970s and it was introduced in many countries during the following decade. However, some countries have never followed this convention, and there is an ongoing discussion to abandon the convention e.g. in EU."

    "Next we will learn how temporal data can be handled in Python in general. The most fundamental Python library for dealing with temporal data is called `datetime` that supplies functionalities to construct and manipulate dates and times. The module is one of the Python's standard libraries, hence you do not need to install it separately. Other useful libraries for dealing with time and dates are `time` and `calendar` which provide some additional functionalities in addition to the functionalities provided by `datetime`. In addition, `pytz` library provides many useful functionalities to deal with time zone information and `dateutil` provides some handy functionalities to automate date parsing. Most often the `datetime` module and `pytz` (in addition to pandas) provide everything you need when doing analysis with temporal data. "

    "## Constructing datetime objects\n",
    "\n",
    "A `datetime` object is a representation of time in a way that Python can understand and operate with it. With the `datetime` library it is possible to construct a `datetime` object for example by `parsing` it from text following the ISO 8601 format or from the Unix timestamp (notice that the name of the library and the object are the same). Let's see how we can construct a `datetime` object from text using a function `strptime()`. The `strptime()` function takes the variable `timestamp` as the first argument representing the time in textual format and a second argument (\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S\") which looks quite complicated, but it is the `format code` that instructs the `datetime` how the textual representation of the time should be interpreted:"

    "As a result we get a `datetime` object in which the date has been converted into a set of numbers, in which the first one is the year, second one is month, third one day, and so on. This structure is always the same, no matter in what format the input data has been. By using the format codes (i.e. the second argument of the function), we can tell the computer that the first component in our string represents year in 4 digits. The `%Y` characters (i.e. a *directive*) is a special way to instruct the computer to do so. In a similar manner, we can instruct the computer to read the month based on numbers with two digits (`12`) using the directive `%m`. As you can see, there is always a `%` character and then some letter after it, which is the way how we determine how the date is formatted in our text. Notice that the date components are separated with dash (`-`) and the time components are separated with colons (`:`). As we can see from our format code, we can add those separator characters between the directives just as they are represented in the timestamp. Following this approach it is possible to parse basically any kind of time information represented as text.

Next, we will set the index and specify appropriate time zone for our data (*Europe/Helsinki*).

With this parameter we tell pandas that this is okay, and we just want to shift the time forward (by an hour in most cases) in case there are such \"non-existing\" time observations. With `ambiguous` parameter, we tell pandas that when adjusting the clocks backwards (moving from summer time to winter time), the observations having ambigous times (e.g. duplicate timestamps due to Daylight Saving Time) are set as `NaT` (Not-a-Time).

    "There are a couple of important notions that we can make from the data in this array. Firstly, the Timestamps in the index from the year 1906 seem to have a quite odd time zone information attached to them (+01:40), which differs from the offset of the last observations (+03:00) by an hour and twenty minutes. This might seem a bit strange, although everything is as it should, and a couple of international conventions regarding time explain these differences. First explanation relates to a fact that representing local time following time zone specification as an offset from UTC is merely a contract between countries targeted to standardize the representation of time in different parts of the world. But as with any international contract, the standardization process typically happens at different times in different countries, and it is not unheard of to make changes to these agreements. An example of such a change can be witnessed here, as Finland changed its time zone from Helsinki Mean Time (with +01:40 offset from UTC) to Eastern European Time (with +02:00 from UTC) in May 1st 1921. Hence, all timestamps recorded before the aforementioned date have a somewhat unusual offset from UTC (100 minutes). Similar special arrangements have been quite common in the history, so it is good to be careful and aware of these situations whenever working with historical time series. Second important convention relates to the Daylight Saving Time (DST), which was introduced in Finland in 1981, and is the reason why the last values in our DatetimeIndex have an offset of +03:00 (summer time) instead of +02:00. As you might guess, all these international practices and contracts can make working with date and time information quite tricky. Luckily, pandas (and the underlying pytz library) handles these things very well, and we do not need to worry too much about the international time convensions.     \n",

    "In some occasions, you might want to convert your time series data from one time zone to another. If you for example, would like to understand what the time was in New York when these weather observations were recorded, you could convert the time information easily with `.dt.tz_convert()` function. Before making the conversion between the time zones, we need to return the TIME Series from the index back to a normal pandas column by using `.reset_index()` method that returns the `TIME` column back to DataFrame as a normal column. When manipulating time series, it is quite typical to set a specific column as an index for the DataFrame and then swap it back to a \"normal\" column for further manipulation, as in the following: "

This functionality can be very useful when working with temporal data from different parts of the world. Quite often the data collected from different global services (such as tweets collected from Twitter) store the information as UTC values. Hence, it is up to the user to parse the correct local time for tweets posted in different parts of the world. Using pandas for doing these kind of manipulation with the temporal data is extremely handy and efficient. In case your data is already represented in different timezones, pandas makes your life easy because timestamps are stored under the hood always in UTC. This means that it is straightforward to do operations between the two time series without any additional timezone conversions. We can for example do simple calculations between two DataFrames that are represented in different timezones:  "

When doing interpolation, you fill missing values between observations based on specific criteria, such as taking the average between two consecutive observations. For instance, you could interpolate hourly temperature observations into 30 minute frequencies by assuming that the temperature in the middle of two time steps, such as 14:00 and 15:00, is the average of both giving you an estimate what the temperature might be at 14:30.

For instance, stock market data or GPS observations representing the movement / speed profiles of vehicles are good examples of datasets that typically have a lot of variance, which can make it challenging to see patterns without smoothing.

    "As we see, the first rows in our sample contains observations every 3 hours or so. Let's test how we can apply rolling statistic over our tiem series and calculate a moving average based on four closest (consecutive) temperature observations. To do this, we can use a method called `.rolling()` that by default takes an integer number as an argument that specify how many observations should be grouped together (i.e. window size). By chaining the `.mean()` command after the first one, we can specify that we want to calculate the average temperature based on those four observations:"

    "As a result, we get a Series in which the time is the index and the newly calculated average temperatures are the values. As can be seen from here, the first three temperature values are NaNs which is expected, as we specified that the average should always be based on four consecutive observations. Hence,  with the first three observations the average cannot be calculated, and in this case pandas returns NaN. \n",
    "\n",
    "An important thing to notice here, is that the temporal resolution of our data seem to vary. This can be seen by comparing the first and last five timestamps to each other: in early 90's the frequency of the observations was 3 hours, but during 2019 the frequency has been 1 hour. This is a significant issue, because the temporal span of how the moving average is calculated differs, which can cause unwanted consequenses and errors in our analysis. Luckily, it is easy to fix this issue by passing a *{term}`DateOffset`* as an argument for the `.rolling()` command, in a similar manner as we did earlier when resampling our data. Hence, we can e.g. use a fixed window size of 1 day by passing \"1D\" to the function, and it will always keep the time span identical, no matter how many observations there would be recorded within a single day:"

    "Following this approach, it is easy to calculate rolling statistics with different window sizes, such as weekly, monthly or even annual averages. The main different between `.rolling()` and `.resample()` is that the former will maintain the number of observations in the data (but change the values according neighboring values e.g. based on mean), whereas the latter will actually aggregate and reduce the number of observations that will be kept in the result. To demonstrate the influence of \"smoothing\" to our time series based on moving average, let's calculate the moving average of temperatures based on window size of 180 days and 360 days (~year), and plot the results (details about plotting are discussed in the next chapter):"

This method basically cumulates the information on each observation and can be useful e.g. in some predictive applications where cumulative information about the given phenomena can provide more accurate results after more observations have been observed. It is also possible to apply and chain your own functions together with `.rolling()` and `.expanding()`, such as `.rolling(20).apply(myOwnFunction)`. "
