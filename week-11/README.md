# Week 11: Spatial Analysis Part 03: Spatial Regression
## Quiz 04
Navigate to this [link](http://geospatial-data-analytics.briannapagan.com/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbriannapagan%2Fgeospatial-data-analytics-spring-2023&branch=main&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fgeospatial-data-analytics-spring-2023%2Fweek-11%2Fquiz) to open your jupyter environment and complete the quiz. Download and attach your final .ipynb to Brightspace or upload to your own github and supply a link on Brightspace. 

## Getting Started
During class, navigate to the following [link](http://geospatial-data-analytics.briannapagan.com/hub/user-redirect/git-pull?repo=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fbriannapagan%2Fgeospatial-data-analytics-spring-2023&branch=main&urlpath=lab%2Ftree%2Fgeospatial-data-analytics-spring-2023%2Fweek-11) to access notebooks where we will be learning some core concepts.


You will be expected to follow along and 'live script' the examples in your own notebook. 

## Final Exam
Your final is scheduled for next week April 4th. Details to be discussed in class. All content except week-09 will be covered. 

**Study Guide**
- Working with time series data. Loading, cleaning, subsetting, using aggregation functions.
- Geospatial conceptual basics. Understanding different coordinate reference systems, datums etc. Vector versus raster data. Data file types. 
- Working with vector data. Functionalities with geopandas. 
- Reprojecting spatial data.
- Clipping and joining spatial data (either vector or raster).
- Dissolving vector data.
- Single and multi-band raster analysis.
- Reclassifying raster data. 
- Nearest neighbor analysis. 
- Zonal statistics.
- Spatial regression.
- Understanding various raster data sources (NAIP, Landsat, Sentinel).
- Basic visualizations of vector/raster data.
