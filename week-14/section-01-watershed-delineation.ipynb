    "Pysheds is an open-source library designed to help with processing of digital elevation models (DEMs), particularly for hydrologic analysis. Pysheds performs many of the basic hydrologic functions offered by commercial software such as ArcGIS, including catchment delineation and accumulation computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pysheds is designed with speed in mind. It can delineate a flow direction grid of ~10 million cells in less than 5 seconds. Flow accumulation for a grid of 36 million cells can be computed in about 15 seconds. These methods can be readily automated and incorporated into web services: for instance, a web mapping service like leaflet.js could use pysheds to generate contributing areas for locations of interest on-the-fly.\n",
